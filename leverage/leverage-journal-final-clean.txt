"Excellence is a habit, not an accident." — Aristotle

Dedication
To every empire builder who refuses to settle for ordinary.
To those who understand that greatness is not a destination, but a daily discipline.
To the visionaries who see systems where others see chaos, who find leverage where others find limitation.
This journal is your companion on the journey from dreamer to empire builder.
